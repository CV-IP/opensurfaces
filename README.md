# OpenSurfaces

OpenSurfaces is a large database of annotated surfaces created from real-world
consumer photographs. Our annotation framework draws on crowdsourcing to
segment surfaces from photos, and then annotate them with rich surface
properties, including material, texture and contextual information.

Run `install_all.sh` to install all components (will use ~15G disk space).
