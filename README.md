# OpenSurfaces

OpenSurfaces is a large database of annotated surfaces created from real-world
consumer photographs. Our annotation framework draws on crowdsourcing to
segment surfaces from photos, and then annotate them with rich surface
properties, including material, texture and contextual information.

Documentation is available at: http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/docs/

If you are on Ubuntu 12.04 or later, you can run `install_all.sh` to install
all components (will use ~15G disk space).

If you're on Windows and want to run the code, install
(VirtualBox)[https://www.virtualbox.org/] and install Ubuntu 12.04 as a virtual
machine since some of the required packages don't have Windows versions.
