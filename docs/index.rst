OpenSurfaces Documentation
==========================

OpenSurfaces is a large database of annotated surfaces created from real-world
consumer photographs. Our annotation framework draws on crowdsourcing to
segment surfaces from photos, and then annotate them with rich surface
properties, including material, texture and contextual information.

Our code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/seanbell/opensurfaces.  If
you use our code, please cite our paper:

    | Sean Bell, Paul Upchurch, Noah Snavely, Kavita Bala
    | *OpenSurfaces: A Richly Annotated Catalog of Surface Appearance*
    | ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2013)

and if you use the Intrinsic Images code, please also cite:

    | Sean Bell, Kavita Bala, Noah Snavely
    | *Intrinsic Images in the Wild*
    | ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH 2014)

We'd love to hear what you build using our code; please tell us about your
projects by emailing :email:`sbell@cs.cornell.edu` (Sean Bell).
