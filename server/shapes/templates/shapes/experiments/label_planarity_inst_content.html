	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Planar is NOT the same as flat.  It is a related but different concept.  Please read the instructions below to see the difference.</p>
</div>

<p>You will be shown a collection of images with objects outlined in red.
Click on the objects that are <i>planar</i> -- regions with a single flat
surface.</p>

<p>Planar shapes can have some variation, such as patterns on wood, or grooves
between bricks, or fuzz on a carpet.  For example, a brick or tile wall is
still considered planar.</p>

<p>However, two very different planar surfaces (such as two perpendicular walls
in the same red shape) do not count and should be rejected.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Examples (side view)</h2>
<p>To explain what &quot;planar&quot; means, consider these examples.  They are
<i>side views</i> of objects.</p>
