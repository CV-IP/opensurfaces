<p>A &quot;texture&quot; is any pattern on a surface.  Some example textures:
wood, steel, brick, ceramic, plastic, brick, tile.  A mirror or window counts
as a texture, even though you can see the objects inside the mirror.</p>

<p>If a shape contains some portion of another material or texture, reject it.
For example, if the open space inside a mug handle is not removed with a red
line, do not select the shape.</p>
