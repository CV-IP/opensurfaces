<p>Select the name that best describes the material of the highlighted portion.
If you make a mistake, click the &quot;Go back&quot; button to change your
answer.  To better see the highlighted shape, you can drag the image with the
mouse or zoom in using the &quot;Zoom in&quot; button.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine the material, please <u>do not guess</u>.
Instead, select one of the options at the bottom of the list:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal" style="margin-left: 40px">
	<dt>Not on list</dt> <dd>You know the material but it is not on the
	list.</dd> <dt>More than one material</dt> <dd>There is more than one
	material highlighted by the red shape.</dd> <dt>I can't tell</dt> <dd>The
	shape is too small or you do not know the material.</dd>
</dl>

<br/>
<h3>Should I guess if I am unsure?</h3>
<p>No.  Please choose &quot;I can't tell&quot;.  We understand that many images
are ambiguous.</p>

<h3>What do I choose for painted walls and ceilings?</h3>
<p>For solid color painted walls, please select &quot;Painted&quot; since it is
impossible to know what is below the paint.  If the wall is decorated with
wallpaper, select &quot;Wallpaper&quot;.</p>

<h3>What if the laminate looks like tile, granite, or wood?</h3>
If a countertop or floor <i>looks</i> like granite, but you think it is
actually laminate, select &quot;Granite&quot; anyway.  The same applies to
other surfaces -- e.g. if it is designed to look like wood or tile, select
&quot;Wood&quot; or &quot;Tile&quot; respectively.</p>

<h3>What if the wood has varnish?</h3>
<p>Finished wood and wood with varnish should be labeled &quot;Wood&quot;.  If
the outermost layer is solid opaque paint (e.g. white paint), select
&quot;Painted&quot;.  Otherwise, select &quot;Wood&quot;.</p>

<h3>What if there is glass/mirror in front?</h3>
<p>Please label the <i>closest</i> surface.  If there is glass in front, select
&quot;Glass&quot;.  If the shape is a reflection inside a mirror, select
&quot;Mirror&quot;.</p>

<h3>What do I choose for paintings/posters?</h3>
<p>If you can tell that there is glass in front, select &quot;Glass&quot;.  For
oil/latex/acrylic paintings, select &quot;Painted&quot;.  For posters, select
&quot;Paper&quot;.  If there is any ambiguity, please select &quot;I can't
tell&quot; (we would rather that you select this instead of guess).</p>

<h3>What about marble tile?</h3>
<p>If it is arranged in a regular grid pattern, please select &quot;Tile&quot;</p>

<h3>What about painted wood?</h3>
<p>If the outermost layer is solid opaque paint (e.g. white paint), select
&quot;Painted&quot;.  Otherwise, select &quot;Wood&quot;.</p>

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>We are building a database of materials from images on the web.
This is part of ongoing research at Cornell University.  Thank you for
