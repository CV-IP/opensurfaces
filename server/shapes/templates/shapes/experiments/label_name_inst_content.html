<p>Your task is to label the name of objects. Each image has a
single object (or part of an object) highlighted in red.</p>

<p>If you make a mistake, click the &quot;Go back&quot; button to change your
answer.</p>

<p>To better see the highlighted shape, you can drag the image with
the mouse or zoom in using the &quot;Zoom in&quot; button.</p>

<p>If you cannot determine the object name, please <strong>do not guess</strong>.
Instead, select one of the options at the bottom of the list:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal" style="margin-left: 40px">
	<dt>Not on list</dt> <dd>You know the object but it is not on the
	list.</dd> <dt>More than one object</dt> <dd>There is more than one
	object highlighted by the red shape.</dd> <dt>I can't tell</dt> <dd>The
	shape is too small or you do not know the object.</dd>
</dl>

<p><span class="label label-important">Note:</span> If a small portion of an
object is highlighted, it is okay to use the name of the entire object.</p>

<h4>If the door on the dishwasher is outlined, do you say that it is a "door" or a "dishwasher"?</h4>
<p>You should put "dishwasher".  The same applies to cabinets and refrigerators.</p>

<h4>If the entire floor is covered in carpet, do I select "Rug/mat" or "Floor"?</h4>
<p>You should put "Floor".  "Rug/mat" refers to removable rugs, not to carpet
stapled to the floor.  The same applies to carpet stairs -- please put
"Stairs".</p>

<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>We are building a database of objects and materials from images on the web.
This is part of ongoing research at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Thank you for participating!</p>
