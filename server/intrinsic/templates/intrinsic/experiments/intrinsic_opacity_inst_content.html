		<h2>Tutorial</h2>
		<p>The first time you do the task, a tutorial will teach you how to do
		the task.  You only have to do the tutorial once.</p>

		<br/>
		<h2>What to do</h2>
		<p>We will show you a series of points in an image.  Your job is to
		click on the points that are on a transparent surface or a mirror.
		"Transparent" surfaces includes things like glass and clear plastic, as
		well as semi-transparent things such as foggy glass and thin curtains.
		If a point is in the sky, that counts as "transparent" as well.</p>

		{% comment %}
		<p>Each HIT has {{ num_contents }} point{{ num_contents|pluralize }}.
		Don't worry; we will show you large groups of points at a time.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>
To make the task easier, we added some features:
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>Zoom</dt> <dd>To view more of the image, drag the image with your
	mouse or scroll to zoom out.<br/>You can also click the two zoom buttons.</dd>
	<dt>Redo</dt> <dd>Click "Back" if you make a mistake.</dd>
	<dt>Reset</dt> <dd>If you want to start over, you can click the "Reset all
	points" button.  This will turn unselect all points (in the current image
	only).</dd>
</dl>

<br/>
<h2>What if the photo has no transparent or mirror points?</h2>
<p>Don't worry; many photos will have no points to click on.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>We are building a large database of objects and materials from images on the
web.</p>

<p>This is part of ongoing research at Cornell University.  Thank you for
participating!</p>
