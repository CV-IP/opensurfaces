		<h2>Tutorial</h2>
		<p>The first time you do the task, a tutorial will teach you how to do the
		task.  You only have to do the tutorial once.</p>

		<br/>
		<h2>What to do</h2>
		<p>We will show you two points numbered "1" and "2".  Each point is on
		a surface in a photograph.  Your job is to tell us which surface is
		darker.  You should ignore lighting, highlights, reflections, shading
		and focus on the natural surface color of the object.  To help keep
		things straight, point 1 is always on the left, and point 2 is always
		on the right.</p>

		<p>Note that this is not just about which point in the image is darker
		-- we can simply look up the image pixel colors if we wanted that.  The
		point of this task is to get you to separate the effects of lighting
		and surface color.</p>

		<p>Each HIT has between {{ num_contents}} and {{ num_contents_predicted }} comparison{{ num_contents_predicted|pluralize }}.</p>

			<p class="caption">These two points have the same surface color even
			though point 2 is more in shadow.
			The answer is "About the same" and "Definitely" for confidence.</p>

<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>Next to each button there is a letter in parentheses.  You can press this
key instead of clicking the button to go faster.  Note that you need to click
on the task for the shortcuts to work.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>
To make the task easier, we added some features:
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
	<dt>Zoom</dt> <dd>To view more of the image, drag the image with your mouse
	or press "Z" to zoom out.  You can also scroll to zoom.</dd>
	<dt>Highlight</dt> <dd> You can click "Highlight points" to
	have the points flash.</dd>
	<dt>Redo</dt> <dd>Click "Back" if you make a mistake.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Mirrors, windows, and reflective items</h2>
<p>Sometimes you can see reflections inside a mirror.  For these surfaces, you
should consider the mirror surface <i>itself</i>, not what you can see inside.
Okay, so what is the natural surface color of a mirror?  Since it reflects all
light perfectly, all non-mirrors are darker than mirrors.  Shiny items can be
tricky, so if you can't figure out which should be lighter, make your best
guess and then tell us that you are guessing.</p>

<h2>Approving HITs</h2>
<p>We will approve <i>every</i> submission, within seconds.  You deserve to be paid
for your work.  However, we also will monitor your accuracy by comparing with
known answers (we do not use "majority rules").  If your accuracy on these
secret tests drops below a threshold at any time, we will simply disallow you
from submitting (this is not a block, so your account is not flagged).</p>

<br/>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
<p>We are building a large database of objects and materials from images on the
web.</p>

<p>This is part of ongoing research at Cornell University.  Thank you for
participating!</p>
