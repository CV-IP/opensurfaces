		<p>Your task is to adjust controls to make a blob look like it is made out of
		the same material as another shape.  When you are done, the blob and
		the target shape should look similar.</p>

		<p>You will be given the controls on the right to edit the blob.
		Please try moving the sliders around to see what happens to the blob in
		the middle.  If you have trouble finding the color, you can click on
		the &quot;target&quot; image to set the color.</p>

		<p>If you cannot complete the task (e.g. the target has more than one
		material), click &quot;I give up&quot;.  Please give a reason for why you
		cannot match the blob to the target.  If you give up, it will count as a
		completed task.</p>

<h2>What if the target is textured?</h2>

<p>If the target has a texture, please try and find the closest match -- we
understand that this is a subjective task.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>

<p>We are building a large database of objects and materials from images on the
web, and we want to categorize them by metrics such as roughness and apparent
contrast.  You will be giving us these metrics as you complete the task.</p>

<p>This is part of ongoing research at Cornell University.  Thank you for
participating!</p>
